# NMDOrfs
A workflow to computationally detect transcripts that could generate several distinct ORFs that match to the same protein. This can be used to find for example nonsense-mediated decay transcripts that make more than one ORF.

**Usage 

The workflow uses a local NCBI Blast installation. It uses the makeblastdb and blastp executables. The latest version can be downloaded [here](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

The python scipts are written for Python 2.7
