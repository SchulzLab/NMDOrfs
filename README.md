# NMDOrfs
A workflow to computationally detect transcripts that could generate several distinct ORFs that match to the same protein. This can be used to find for example nonsense-mediated decay transcripts that make more than one ORF.

**Usage 
The workflow uses a loal Blast installation. It uses the makedb and blastp executables.
